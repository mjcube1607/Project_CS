Objectives:
We were asked to design a secure cloud architecture for a company that has minimal cloud resources implemented. Any cloud provider can be used, we used AWS and their inbuilt services to improve the security posture of the company.

Conclusion:
Using AWS secure services we were able to secure information, access management and network traffic. The proposed architecture was also required to maintain efficiency and scalability during disaster events.
